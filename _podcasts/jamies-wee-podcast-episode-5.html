<p>
  For anyone looking to grow & monetise their Instagram, there is one couple who have managed to do that in a current climate of when many have felt the squeeze on their growth and reach.
  <br><br>
  Gavin and Mikali, a 20 something couple from Australia and who base themselves in Perth, have managed to turn their passion for travel and photography into a business through their Instagram account, Life Before Kids.
  <br><br>
  I sat down with Gav at his home in Manning, South Perth, and shared a bottle of whisky as we discussed everything before, during and after Life Before Kids.
  <br><br>
  From a teacher in training and an off-shore worker they have managed to develop their self taught digital and photography skills to a point where they now work with brands and services to produce a self-sustaining income.
  <br><br>
  Gav let me in on how he went from someone who had never picked up a camera before into someone who now produces professional photographer standard content to the point where he is in the process of creating his very own online photography course.
  <br><br>
  He also goes into great depth on how there would be no Life Before Kids before Mikali and that without her he wouldn’t be able to do what he does.
  <br><br>
  From their first collaboration to working with some of the top brands and services in the world, plus why Gav feels extra pressure to succeed due to the farming family lineage, this is an episode packed full of content and for anyone in the travel couple niche.
