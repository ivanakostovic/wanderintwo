<p>
  What started as just normal pain from the eye, something Ivana deals with from time to time being a contact lens wearer, quickly developed into a Bali hospital nightmare.
  <br><br>
  In this episode, my first ever podcast guest Ivana Kostovich documents her story about how catching an eye infection in Bali almost lead to the loss of not only her vision but of her entire left eye.
  <br><br>
  We begin the episode talking about Ivana’s initial thoughts on the medical care that she received at the Bali hospital and from the medical staff.
  <br><br>
  After 9 days of treatment, 4 hospital visits, countless different eye doctors including an infection specialist in Nusa Dua, we made the decision to cut our Bali holiday short and head straight to Ngurah Rai airport and travel to Australia for treatment.
  <br><br>
  Upon landing in Perth we headed straight to Sir Charles Gairdner emergency services department which is where Ivana was admitted straight away and kept in hospital for 3.5 weeks over Christmas and New Years.
  <br><br>
  We discuss everything from why you should never take the risk with Bali medical care if you have any doubts, why having travel insurance is absolutely vital before you travel to Bali or anywhere in Indonesia, plus the mental and physical health implications Ivana has been through and will continue to endure for years to come.
  <br><br>
  What started as a pain in the eye became an abrasion, to a severe infection, to almost losing the eye, to where Ivana is at now which is with a massive scar on her cornea with the threat of needing a cornea transplant in future.
