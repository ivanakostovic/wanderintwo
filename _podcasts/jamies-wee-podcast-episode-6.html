<p>
  It’s difficult to escape the news regarding all things Coronavirus. From the mainstream media, social media and even just seeing the behaviours of people when you’re out and about, you would be forgiven for feeling like this is a doomsday scenario.
  <br><br>
  For the first time ever on this podcast, I take a look at a trending topic and dissect it with my own thoughts and opinions.
  <br><br>
  I discuss everything Coronavirus related and look to debunk some of the myths surrounding this disease.
