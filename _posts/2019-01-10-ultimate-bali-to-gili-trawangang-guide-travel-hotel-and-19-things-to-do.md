## Where is Gili T

Gili Trawangan is located east of Bali and west of Lombok. It is one of the three Gili Islands between these two larger islands. Along with Gili Meno then Gili Air, in order of west to east, Gili T is the most popular of the three due to its geo location to Bali, its nightlife and things to do and the frequency of the transport on and off the island.

Is Gili T in Bali? Well that’s what I thought\! However, the Gili Trawangan map below exposed my terrible geography skills and clearly shows the Gili Islands are actually much closer to Lombok than Bali.

Distance from Padang Bai (Bali) to Gili Trawangan: 61.8 Kilometres / 38.4 MilesDistance from Bangsal Harbour (Lombok) to Gili Trawangan: 6.7 Kilometres / 4.1 Miles

## Gili Trawangan weather

When should you visit the Gili Islands? The easy answer to this is between June and late August, which is considered the high season. Of course, visiting during the high season means the island becomes so much more populated with tourists. However, it’s also the time when you are guaranteed to get the best weather and best vibe in Gili Trawangan.

Wet season in Gili T is around late October until late March. Even then, when the rain is lashing down in Bali or on Lombok you can often find that the Gili Islands weather is still sunny and dry.

If you really want the perfect Gili T weather then the ideal months are May and September. Cyclone season isn’t an issue, the weather is pretty much dry and the larger crowds that you find during high season are nowhere to be seen.

## How to get to Gili Trawangan

#### Bali to Gili Trawangan transport

Can you fly to Gili T? Does Gili T have an airport? Unfortunately the answer is no. Travelling from Bali to the Gili Islands isn’t always the easiest journey, but it’s definitely not impossible and it’s absolutely worth it\!

Our journey from Bali to Gili T began at Padang Bai on the south-eastern coast of Bali. Catching the boat from Bali to Gili Trawangan can be a daunting experience, especially if this is your first time venturing to the neighbouring islands. It can be pretty intense in the heat with the influx of travellers and the locals trying to sell you things.

Heading from Padang Bai to Gili at around 09:00, we made sure to catch the earliest possible transport to maximise our time on Gili T.

There are two main options to travel from Padang Bai to Gili Trawangan and those are either the fast boat or local ferry. The fast boat to Gili Trawangan from Bali takes around one and a half hours. Taking the local ferry to Lombok and then on to the Gili Islands from there can take anything up to eight hours in total\!

Just be aware that taking the Bali to Gili Trawangan boat can be a little temperamental due to the ocean swells. If you are prone to getting seasick then don’t worry – the boats have plenty of sick bags available. Also, due to the swells the boats are prone to last-minute cancellation so be prepared for that.

Fast boat from Bali to Gili Trawangan cost (1.5 hours): From 250K IDR pp one way / From 600K IDR returnLocal ferry from Bali to Lombok cost (5 hours): From 40K IDRLocal ferry from Lombok to Gili Trawangan cost (30 mins): 15K IDRFast boat from Lombok to Gili Trawangan cost (15 mins): 85K IDR

#### Fly to Lombok airport and get the boat to Gili T

Another popular option, rather than brave the long boat journey from Bali, is to take a cheap flight to Lombok and travel to the Gili Islands from there.

A taxi journey from Lombok airport to Bangsal Harbour takes around two hours and will cost about 300K IDR. A more expensive way of doing it for the ballers amongst us. As previously stated, Lombok is so much closer to the Gili Islands than Bali is. Therefore, the boat journey from Lombok is a fraction of the time and cost. However, when you add in the cost of a flight and taxi journey it most definitely works out more expensive this way.

#### Gili Trawangan to Bali transport

We took the Karunya Jaya fast boat back from to Bali from Gili Trawangan which wasn’t without incident.

We were told to come 24 hours before to check in to our boat and make sure we had a place on the early boat. This is what we did. However, in doing so we were told we were too late, that the early boat was full and that we should have come 48 hours before to check in instead\!

We wanted that early Gili Trawangan to Bali transport so bad. We had a long scooter ride from Padang Bai to Canggu on the other side, so the last thing we wanted was to take the afternoon boat. This often means driving back in the dark.

Thankfully, after some begging, we were put on a waiting list and we made sure we queued up early the next day to ensure we were the first picks when people dropped out. Luck was on our side that day and feeling ever so grateful we made our way back to Bali on the early fast boat.

Make sure that whatever boat you take, you are familiar with their process and know when you need to confirm your check in for your return trip.
