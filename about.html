    <h2 class= padded>Hi, I'm Ivana</h2>
    <p>I was born on the other side of the world, in the land of the long white cloud - Aotearoa, New Zealand, to Croatian parents.
      <br><br>Always a dreamer, I skipped four months of foundation level maths at age 15 to live for a summer in Croatia (and I am terrible at maths to this day). I then danced ballet and professional hip hop until the age of 25, completed a marine science degree for fun, somehow got involved in digital marketing and made the right of passage move to London on my big O.E. (overseas experience). I've been based out of the U.K. ever since.
      <br><br>New Zealand has given me a love for nature, animals and the environment. It has taught me the importance of balance, how to maintain the ultimate state of chill and to always treat people with love and kindness. Croatia has given me a love for family, traditons and storytelling. It has taught me the art of the enjoyment of life, the beauty of community and the value of hard work.
      <br><br>Having travelled to 30 countries before I turned 30, I always knew deep down that I was a freedom loving adventurer keen to squeeze as much out of life as possible. All that was missing was someone by my side to experience it all with.

    <h2 class= padded>Hello, I'm Jamie</h2>
    <p>I was born in Stirling, bonny Scotland, but grew up in a town called Falkirk - best known for its massive horse heads (The Kelpies), big wheel and being equidistant to Edinburgh and Glasgow.
      <br><br>I left school half way through my exams to fulfil my dream of becoming a professional footballer after being offered a full-time contract with lower league Scottish side Stenhousemuir. After two successful but injury plagued years I had to make the difficult decision to quit football. Thankfully, my football manager had a friend and managed to get me a plumbing and heating trade apprenticeship.
      <br><br>At 26 and working as a technical gas engineer for British Gas, my life was pretty sweet. I had a nice flat in town which I stayed in with friends, a well paid job, a good social life and was surrounded by friends and family. However, feeling unfulfilled and that something was missing I took the chance and moved to London.
      <br><br>For four years London kept me occupied with all it had to offer. From rooftop bars, sporting events, music concerts and pretty much anything else London had going on, I induldged in absolutely everything.
      <br><br>However, as I've gotten older I've realised I value a life of experience. I've always had a keen passion for adventure and an ambition to travel the world. I never thought this would become a reality before I met Ivana.
