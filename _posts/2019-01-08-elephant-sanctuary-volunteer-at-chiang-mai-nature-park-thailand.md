Regarded as not only the best elephant sanctuary in Chiang Mai but also the best elephant sanctuary in Thailand,&nbsp;***[ELEPHANT NATURE PARK](https://www.elephantnaturepark.org/){: target="_blank"}***&nbsp;is the perfect place for anyone looking to become an elephant sanctuary volunteer. To volunteer with elephants is one of the most rewarding things you could possibly imagine to do.

In a world where we are the first generation to realise we are destroying it and the last to do anything about it, this could be your way of contributing towards that movement.

One of our travel bucket list items before setting off to experience the world, was to become elephant volunteers in Thailand. The reason behind it being Thailand is because we done extensive research to ensure we were doing it where we could be certain that the sanctuary performed ethical elephant rescue on rehabilitation.

Our research pointed us towards this incredible Elephant sanctuary in Thailand called Elephant Nature Park.

If you want to contribute towards ethical animal rescue in Thailand and would love to become an elephant sanctuary volunteer then read about our experience and make sure you too experience the life changing Elephant Nature Park.

## The history behind this elephant rescue park in Chiang Mai

Elephant conservation in Thailand has seen a massive shift in recent years. Elephant Nature Park is an elephant sanctuary and rescue centre in Chiang Mai, Thailand that rescue and rehabilitate elephants that are abused through being forced to work in trades such as illegal logging, street begging, forced breeding, circus and entertainment shows, and elephant riding or trekking.

Co-founded in the 1990’s by Sangduen ‘Lek’ Chailert, it now seeks to provide a forever home for these elephants. There are currently around 70 elephants residing in the 250 acres of Elephant Nature Park grounds.

Visitors and elephant sanctuary volunteers to the park can participate in activities such as bathing, feeding and preparing meals for the elephants, as well as walking with them on treks.

This is one amazing organisation and they don’t just rescue elephants. They have rescued many buffalo from the meat trade too. In 2011 there was a massive flood in Bangkok which evacuated the city. Elephant Nature Park hired boats to rescue over 2000 dogs and cats too.

They tried to return as many as possible to their owners and rehomed most that were un-wanted or un-reunited. Over 350 remain at Elephant Nature Park in the dog rescue centre and in ’Cat Kingdom’.
