  Have you ever wondered how influencers, content creators and Instagrammers make money by having an engaged online following? Well, no one does it better than the team behind the travel couple account Love Life Passport.
  <br><br>
  I sat down with Tayler who is one of the most energetic, positive and passionate business gurus you will find on Instagram. With an extremely contagious and infectious energy, it’s not hard to see why him, his wife to be Anika and the other members of the Love Life Passport team have become a roaring success.
  <br><br>
  In this episode, we delve into his early years of growing up in Germany and the life-changing challenges and decisions he encountered on his way from working at the bottom rung of the ladder in the hospitality business to the beautiful world travelling entrepreneurs based in Dubai.
  <br><br>
  This is a warts and all chat which also includes how Tayler tried his hand at being the German Justin Bieber, his brief stint at trying to crack it as a professional footballer and also what he learned after spending 3 days in the company of the world-renowned Gary Vee.
  <br><br>
  This is the first interview Tayler has ever conducted in English so I couldn’t be happier to bring this exclusive insight.
