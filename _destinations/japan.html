description: Japan is famous for many things - kimonos, sushi, anime, sumo wrestling, cosplay, kareoke... the list just goes on and on! With an incredible contrast of traditional and contemporary, it's one of the most unique destinations we have ever been.<br><br>There are many things to do in Japan such as staying in a capsule hotel or a ryokan, visiting one of the many temples and shrines, buying snacks or t-shirts or toys or other random items from a vending machine, relaxing in an onsen, experiencing a toilet that plays music, warms the seat and automatically opens when you approach, indulging in a bowl of ramen, geisha hunting, chasing cherry blossoms across the country and so much more! Japan is freaking awesome!<br><br>Japan's top rated tourist attractions include Mount Fuji, Arashiyama Bamboo Grove, Takeshita Street, Shibuya Crossing, Nara Deer Park and Fushimi Inari Shrine.<br><br>You can move easily between Japan's many regions and cities via the super efficient Shinkansen trains as well as other regional trains, buses and metro. Honestly, we only covered Osaka, Kyoto and Tokyo before flying to Okinawa and we feel like we barely scratched the surface of these places! There is certainly plenty to see.<br><br>Japan is a country that we would revisit in a heartbeat!
