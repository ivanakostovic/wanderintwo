I"f<p>Regarded as not only the best elephant sanctuary in Chiang Mai but also the best elephant sanctuary in Thailand, <strong><em><a href="https://www.elephantnaturepark.org/" target="_blank">ELEPHANT NATURE PARK</a></em></strong> is the perfect place for anyone looking to become an elephant sanctuary volunteer. To volunteer with elephants is one of the most rewarding things you could possibly imagine to do.</p>

<p>In a world where we are the first generation to realise we are destroying it and the last to do anything about it, this could be your way of contributing towards that movement.</p>

<p>One of our travel bucket list items before setting off to experience the world, was to become elephant volunteers in Thailand. The reason behind it being Thailand is because we done extensive research to ensure we were doing it where we could be certain that the sanctuary performed ethical elephant rescue on rehabilitation.</p>

<p>Our research pointed us towards this incredible Elephant sanctuary in Thailand called Elephant Nature Park.</p>

<p>If you want to contribute towards ethical animal rescue in Thailand and would love to become an elephant sanctuary volunteer then read about our experience and make sure you too experience the life changing Elephant Nature Park.</p>

<h2 id="the-history-behind-this-elephant-rescue-park-in-chiang-mai">The history behind this elephant rescue park in Chiang Mai</h2>

<p>Elephant conservation in Thailand has seen a massive shift in recent years. Elephant Nature Park is an elephant sanctuary and rescue centre in Chiang Mai, Thailand that rescue and rehabilitate elephants that are abused through being forced to work in trades such as illegal logging, street begging, forced breeding, circus and entertainment shows, and elephant riding or trekking.</p>

<p>Co-founded in the 1990’s by Sangduen ‘Lek’ Chailert, it now seeks to provide a forever home for these elephants. There are currently around 70 elephants residing in the 250 acres of Elephant Nature Park grounds.</p>

<p>Visitors and elephant sanctuary volunteers to the park can participate in activities such as bathing, feeding and preparing meals for the elephants, as well as walking with them on treks.</p>

<p>This is one amazing organisation and they don’t just rescue elephants. They have rescued many buffalo from the meat trade too. In 2011 there was a massive flood in Bangkok which evacuated the city. Elephant Nature Park hired boats to rescue over 2000 dogs and cats too.</p>

<p>They tried to return as many as possible to their owners and rehomed most that were un-wanted or un-reunited. Over 350 remain at Elephant Nature Park in the dog rescue centre and in ’Cat Kingdom’.</p>

<p>Elephant Nature Park don’t just help the elephants and other animals, they help families and the community too. Every time they make an elephant rescue they give the Mahout or ex-owner a chance to work with or move to Elephant Nature Park to be with their elephant and continue life under their good practices.</p>

<p>They even give the Mahout or ex-owners families a home and a job at Elephant Nature Park and provide all meals, utilities, and even an education for their children for free.</p>

<p>Elephant Nature Park support their community through initiatives like Elephant Nature Coffee, which re-trains ex-owners with a new profitable occupation and teaches them how to grow coffee under the rainforest canopy, which Elephant Nature Park buy back from them.</p>

<p>They also buy tonnes of corn, butternut, watermelon and bananas from local farmers to feed the elephants. This helps to maintain the integrity of surrounding communities and preserve the culture of the people who live in those communities.</p>

<p>Elephant Nature Park are also dedicated to restoring the environment in the surrounding areas of their parks. By planting trees and re-introducing rainforest flora, they hope to restore ecological balance eventually.</p>
