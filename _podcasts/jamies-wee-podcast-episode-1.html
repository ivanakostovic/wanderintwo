<p>
  Starting a podcast is a pretty daunting experience. From how to start a podcast, how to record a podcast and creating a podcast for audio and video for the very first time, what you see in my very first episode is the end product of being completely self-taught in all of that.
  <br><br>
  You could be here for a few different reasons which include witnessing my first ever podcast or to get some first-hand information on how to start a podcast from someone who had absolutely zero prior experience. Having navigated the waters of the Instagram and blogging world, having to create, populate and master new platforms such as YouTube, Spotify, Itunes etc has been an exciting new challenge.
  <br><br>
  Thankfully my experience of optimisation in terms of SEO for the blog, and knowing the basic principles behind each channel I felt really comfortable about creating this podcast and publishing it for the world to judge. I had the benefit of having some experience in audio, video and social media branding which really helped me feel comfortable and confident in this final product.
  <br><br>
  I really appreciate anyone who finds themselves here for what is a massive accomplishment for me and a brand new exciting project which I have every ambition to make a success. Have a watch or a listen and let me know what you think. Thank you!
