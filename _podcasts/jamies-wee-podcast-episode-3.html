<p>
  After what can only be described as a trauma-free 22 years on earth, the floodgates well and truly opened on me in 2008.
  <br><br>
  A timeline which includes 5 deaths of friends and family who were near and dear to me, a long term relationship break up, changing jobs for the first time only to be threatened with dismissal in the first few weeks and buying my first property in the recession with the threat of no income, it’s fair to say I more than caught up on trauma that year.
  <br><br>
  I talk you through the timeline of these unfortunate events, the self-destruction that followed, which I was completely unaware of, and the unlikely hero who stepped in, showed compassion when they had the power to completely destroy me, and subsequently turned my life around.
  <br><br>
  The value in this episode is the power of compassion and how it has the ability to heal and save those who are crying out for help.
  <br><br>
  Also round up the episode talking about why I started a Patreon account and how it can help me sustain this podcast long term.
