<p>
  I am absolutely delighted to be joined on this episode with Bali based breathwork expert Edward Dangerfield.
  <br><br>
  Originally from the Isle of White and with Canadian citizenship, Edward talks openly about the traumatic event which led him on the path of discovering breathwork.
  <br><br>
  Now plying his trade in Bali under his company name Breathwork Bali, Edward discusses everything from the science behind breathwork, the physical, mental and emotional benefits of breathwork, and also the services that his company offer here in Indonesia.
  <br><br>
  Edward is one of the most captivating, fascinating and articulate guys I have ever met and it is clear to see why he is regarded as one of the world’s greatest breathwork experts.
