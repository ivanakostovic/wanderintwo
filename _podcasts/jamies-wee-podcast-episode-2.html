<p>
  As an ‘Instagram couple’ or ‘Travel blogging couple’ we are asked A LOT of questions on a daily basis. Of all the questions we are asked there seems to be one that pops up more often than others and that is “How did you quit your job and travel the world?” and how we managed to fund full-time or long term travel.
  <br><br>
  There is a good chance that if you are reading this with the intention of listening to or watching this podcast episode, that you are having a wee think about how you can go through a similar process.
  <br><br>
  Having experienced the process of making the decision to quit, the process involved in saving money, telling your work, friends and parents about your far-out plans and all the highs, lows, dos, don’ts and not to mention valuable lessons learnt, we have all the information you need to help you make the decision too.
  <br><br>
  In this podcast episode I discuss all the mental attributes you must have to make the decision and follow it through, highlight the sacrifices and strains involved plus the difficult personal situation which put all of our travel plans into a serious doubt just as we were getting set to leave.
