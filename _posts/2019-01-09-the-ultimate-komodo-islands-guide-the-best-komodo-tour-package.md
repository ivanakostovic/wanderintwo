Indonesia is fast becoming one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world with Bali being the heart beat of that. However as everyone looks for the next best destination it seems that the popularity is shifting from Bali to Komodo Island. Home to the famous Komodo Island Pink Beach, Rinca Island, Kelor Island Pulau Komodo, and of course the famous Komodo Dragon Island it isn’t hard to understand why.

If you are looking to indulge your travel gland and want to satisfy the animal lover in you by seing a baby Komodo Dragon then we recommend a Komodo liveaboard. We done a 3 day 2 night Komodo tour package with&nbsp;***[TRAVASS LIFE](https://travass.life/komodoisland/){: target="_blank"}**&nbsp;*who were incredible from start to finish. Thanks to the Komodo Island National Park tours the mainland port of Labuan Bajo has seen a sharp increase in visitors since the 300,000 that passed through in 2017.

Around that time there were around 500-1000 visitors to the Komodo Islands daily but in the years following there has been a massive increase. Beat the impending crowds and come and experience Indonesia’s latest piece of paradise.

We embarked on a 3 day 2 night Komodo live-aboard tour of the Komodo Islands with&nbsp;***[TRAVASS LIFE](https://travass.life/komodoisland/){: target="_blank"}***&nbsp;and it’s one of the best experiences we’ve had in Indonesia. Included was a room with air conditioning, all meals and water (catered to dietary requirements), entrance fees to all the islands, trekking fees, snorkelling equipment, free-flow tea and coffee, pick ups and drop offs and a personal photographer who is equipped with a camera and drone.

They have the best Komodo Islands itinerary. Our first day included visits to Pulau Island, Rinca Island and Kalong Island. Day two included catching the sunrise at Padar Island, Pink Beach, snorkelling at Manta Point and sunset at Sebayur Island.

Our third and final day was spent relaxing at Kanawa Island before making our way back to port. We were dropped at the airport and caught our flight back to Bali that evening.

For us, it was the perfect itinerary as it allowed us to see many of Komodo Islands famous sights at a relaxing pace. We were joined on our boat by six German girls so we made some friends too – bonus\!

Gio and Adel, who own and run the tours are also the loveliest people in the entire world. They really go the extra mile to make sure you maximise your time on these beautiful Komodo Islands. They are joined by a professional Indonesian crew who made our time onboard safe and comfortable.
