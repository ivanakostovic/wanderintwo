description: This former British Colony is an amazing mix of East meets West. It's crazy busy and very vibrant.<br><br>It feels like there are millions of people crammed into such a small space. Yellow taxis buzz about the streets through the traffic alongside the famous city trams known lovingly as ding dings. There are a lot of shopping options from luxury labels to markets with insane amounts of different curiosiies and souvenirs. Big, bright signs in Cantonese hang from the sides of buildings. It's the home of Dim Sum and a plethora of Michelin Star eateries.<br><br>With so many things to experience it's easy to feel overwhelmed. In our four day stop-over we focused on urban exploration rather than visiting Hong Kong's famous attractions, such as Lantau Island HK Disneyland and the various hiking trails. Instead, we took to discovering Hong Kong's towering skyscrapers, fascinating old apartment blocks, architecture and street art.<br><br>Next time, we'll definitely plan to visit for longer so we can experience everything we missed!
