description: Three words to describe Singapore would be clean, safe and expensive! But don't let the last one put you off.<br><br>Known to be a bit of a playground for Crazy Rich Asians, this destination offers many luxury shopping malls, fine-dining options and pricey high-end hotels. On the flip-side, you can also find cheap and delicious food at the hawker centres, hang out in the gardens and parks and explore cultural neighbourhoods like Chinatown, Little India and Kampong Glam.<br><br>Once you make sense of the Metro you'll find it easy peasy to get around to famous Singapore attractions such as Merlion Park, Gardens by the Bay, ArtScience Museum, Raffels Hotel (for a Singapore Sling), Clarke Quay, Orchard Road, Sentosa Island and more.
