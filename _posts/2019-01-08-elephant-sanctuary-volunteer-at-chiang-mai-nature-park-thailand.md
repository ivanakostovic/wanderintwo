Regarded as not only the best elephant sanctuary in Chiang Mai but also the best elephant sanctuary in Thailand,&nbsp;***[ELEPHANT NATURE PARK](https://www.elephantnaturepark.org/){: target="_blank"}***&nbsp;is the perfect place for anyone looking to become an elephant sanctuary volunteer. To volunteer with elephants is one of the most rewarding things you could possibly imagine to do.

In a world where we are the first generation to realise we are destroying it and the last to do anything about it, this could be your way of contributing towards that movement.

One of our travel bucket list items before setting off to experience the world, was to become elephant volunteers in Thailand. The reason behind it being Thailand is because we done extensive research to ensure we were doing it where we could be certain that the sanctuary performed ethical elephant rescue on rehabilitation.

Our research pointed us towards this incredible Elephant sanctuary in Thailand called Elephant Nature Park.

If you want to contribute towards ethical animal rescue in Thailand and would love to become an elephant sanctuary volunteer then read about our experience and make sure you too experience the life changing Elephant Nature Park.
