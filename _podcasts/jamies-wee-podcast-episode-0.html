  Yes! It’s finally here and I couldn’t be happier, more proud or excited. Jamie’s Wee Podcast has long been a pipe dream solo project of mine, but as 2020 is the year of bigger and better things, I have finally turned it into a reality.
  <br><br>
  This isn’t exactly a podcast episode but more of a well-scripted introduction video to give you an idea on what to expect. Consider it an elevator pitch.
  <br><br>
  Filmed in Canggu at Genesis Studios, I had my first ever studio session which included big fancy expensive lights, multi-camera angles and a really cool microphone. I have never felt so cool in my life as I did sat in front of that microphone.
  <br><br>
  The recording of this and the post-production was a whole new experience for me and I can honestly say I have just tripled the workload and things I have to learn and master on the never-ending to-do list.
  <br><br>
  So if you are reading this please have a wee watch and let me know what you think. If you could also check out my brand new channels and show them some support then I would be forever grateful.
  <br><br>
  Thank you!
