<p>
  Have you ever experienced a moment of complete and utter bliss?
  <br><br>
  On this episode, I go off-piste for the first time ever as I chat with the expert movement coach Braedy who runs his business, Blissful Movements, in Bali, Indonesia.
  <br><br>
  We discuss his life before he started Blissful Movements and go through, in intimate detail, the defining moment of bliss which saw him not only solidify his journey of self-improvement but also ignite his passion for helping others find theirs too.
  <br><br>
  An expert in yoga, breathwork and movement, Braedy talks openly and candidly whilst giving so much value on all of these practices and how they can help you both mentally and physically.
