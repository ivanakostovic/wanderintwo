    <h2> The most beautiful Pink Beach in Indonesia and Komodo Dragon Island can all be found on a Komodo Island liveaboard tour </h2>

    <p>Indonesia is fast becoming one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world with Bali being the heart beat of that. However as everyone looks for the next best destination it seems that the popularity is shifting from Bali to Komodo Island. Home to the famous Komodo Island Pink Beach, Rinca Island, Kelor Island Pulau Komodo, and of course the famous Komodo Dragon Island it isn’t hard to understand why.</p>

<p>If you are looking to indulge your travel gland and want to satisfy the animal lover in you by seing a baby Komodo Dragon then we recommend a Komodo liveaboard. We done a 3 day 2 night Komodo tour package with <em><strong><a href="https://travass.life/komodoisland/" target="_blank">TRAVASS LIFE</a></strong> </em>who were incredible from start to finish. Thanks to the Komodo Island National Park tours the mainland port of Labuan Bajo has seen a sharp increase in visitors since the 300,000 that passed through in 2017.</p>

<p>Around that time there were around 500-1000 visitors to the Komodo Islands daily but in the years following there has been a massive increase. Beat the impending crowds and come and experience Indonesia’s latest piece of paradise.</p>

<p>We embarked on a 3 day 2 night Komodo live-aboard tour of the Komodo Islands with <strong><em><a href="https://travass.life/komodoisland/" target="_blank">TRAVASS LIFE</a></em></strong> and it’s one of the best experiences we’ve had in Indonesia. Included was a room with air conditioning, all meals and water (catered to dietary requirements), entrance fees to all the islands, trekking fees, snorkelling equipment, free-flow tea and coffee, pick ups and drop offs and a personal photographer who is equipped with a camera and drone.</p>

<p>They have the best Komodo Islands itinerary. Our first day included visits to Pulau Island, Rinca Island and Kalong Island. Day two included catching the sunrise at Padar Island, Pink Beach, snorkelling at Manta Point and sunset at Sebayur Island.</p>

<p>Our third and final day was spent relaxing at Kanawa Island before making our way back to port. We were dropped at the airport and caught our flight back to Bali that evening.</p>

<p>For us, it was the perfect itinerary as it allowed us to see many of Komodo Islands famous sights at a relaxing pace. We were joined on our boat by six German girls so we made some friends too – bonus!</p>

<p>Gio and Adel, who own and run the tours are also the loveliest people in the entire world. They really go the extra mile to make sure you maximise your time on these beautiful Komodo Islands. They are joined by a professional Indonesian crew who made our time onboard safe and comfortable.</p>

<p class="caption"><em>Our crew for the three days</em></p>

<h2 id="kelor-island-pulau-komodo">Kelor Island (Pulau Komodo)</h2>

<p>Our first destination on our Komodo Islands tour after leaving the port in Labuan Bajo was the uninhabited island of Kelor. We put our sneakers on and jumped in the tender boat that took us to shore. Once ashore we hiked up the trail on the island which is an extremely steep, natural dirt track. The views were amazing and we got some awesome pictures.</p>

<p>The hike back down had us crawling on our bums and we got a little dusty. Once back on flat land we donned our snorkel and mask to enjoy some time swimming around the coral reef. The snorkelling here was absolutely amazing. There were so many tropical fish who were extremely protective of their little patches of coral. The highlight for us was spotting a cuttlefish and following it around for a while.</p>

<p>We were transported back to the boat by tender and there was a delicious vegetarian lunch waiting for us. We ate, sun bathed on the top deck and made our way to the next destination.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/komodo-4.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" /></p>

<p class="caption"><em>The climb got way steeper the higher we went</em></p>

<h2 id="rinca-island-aka-komodo-dragon-island">Rinca Island aka Komodo Dragon Island</h2>

<p>No trip the Komodo Islands would be complete without seeing the Komodo Dragon’s. We landed on Rinca where Komodo Dragons roam free, and made our way to the ranger’s camp. Here we were assigned a ranger as a guide to take us down one of the routes to explore the island and spot some Komodo’s. There are three routes – short, medium and long, so we opted for the short route which offered more shade and less hills. It was a scorcher of a day.</p>

<p>Even though there are almost 2,000 Komodo Dragons on Rinca Island, you’re not guaranteed to always see them. We were lucky enough to see both juveniles around one meter and adults of three meters. We also saw a nest being guarded by a female Komodo. It was really interesting to learn all the facts about the Komodo Dragon from the ranger.</p>

<p>To top off our walk there was a gorgeous hilltop that offered awesome views of the beach. We spent about an hour exploring Rinca before heading back to the boat.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/komodo-5.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" /></p>

<h2 id="kalong-island-for-amazing-sunset-and-bats">Kalong Island for amazing sunset and bats</h2>

<p>Our next stop on our Komodo Islands tour is where we witnessed the most amazing natural phenomenon. Sitting on the top deck we watched as the sun set across the horizon behind this mangrove-covered island. Then like magic, out of nowhere at dusk, thousands of massive bats flew up into the sky and directly above us.</p>

<p>These amazing creatures hang around on the mangroves during the day. As night falls they leave the island as a massive group to look for food. The incredible thing about this is that no one knows where the bats go to actually find their food. Not even the guides or locals. But the bats always return to Kalong Island in the morning. It was one of life’s magic moments that we will never forget.</p>

<p>Retiring to the lower deck we were fed another awesome local Indonesian meal and it was time for bed after a great first day.</p>

<p class="caption"><em>Dusk fell with the most amazing sunset just before the bats took flight</em></p>

<h2 id="instagram-worthy-sunrise-at-padar-island">Instagram worthy sunrise at Padar Island</h2>

<p>Day two started with an early rise at around 05:00 to transfer to Padar Island to begin a hike to the top. This has to be the sunrise spot in the Komodo National Park. It’s a pretty intense climb up various sets of stairs on the track to the very top. But it’s so worth it. The views from here are seriously sublime. If you want one good picture then it’s got to be from Padar.</p>

<p>The light was glowing orange as the sun rose in the distance and lit up the tundra covered hills. This is how we wish we could start our mornings every morning. There was enough time to watch sunrise and take in the gorgeous scenery, meditate a little and really soak it all up. Top tip, turn right after the first set of stairs to have the mountain all to yourself.</p>

<p>As well as some of the best views we’ve ever seen, there was an amazing white sand beach. We climbed down to explore the shoreline before our tender boat picked us up and transferred us back to our boat for breakfast. Make sure you save some time to check out this beach. Trekking Padar Island was one of the many highlights of our time in the Komodo Islands.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/komodo-7.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" /></p>

<p class="caption"><em>This wasn’t even the most amazing view from Padar Island</em></p>

<h2 id="pink-beach-indonesia--komodo-islands">Pink Beach Indonesia – Komodo Islands</h2>

<p>We were extremely excited for the next stop, Pink Beach Komodo. From the boat the sand looked white, but as we approached in the tender it got more pink. Apparently there are only seven pink beaches on the entire planet. There are two theories on how the beach gets its pink colour.</p>

<p>The most popular is that the pink colour comes from dead red corals that get ground down and mix with the white sand. The less popular theory is that the pink colour comes from microscopic animals called foraminifera. Either way, it’s probably the best beach we’ve ever been to.</p>

<p>The beach is uninhabited and completely unspoiled. The way the turquoise-blue sea meets the pink sand is mesmerising, especially when little waves crash on the shore creating whitewash. We found so many amazing seashells here, some the size of our heads. It was one of the richest beach environments we’ve ever been in.</p>

<p>We had plenty of time to swim, snorkel, sunbathe and relax on this beautiful beach. It was seriously a dream. A bonus is that Travass Life have a drone which can get you the perfect picture from above.</p>
